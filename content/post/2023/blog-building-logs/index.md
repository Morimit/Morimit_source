## Log
### 2023.1.9
- Changed the sidebar image, footer and theme color.
- Deleted the categories and search in the left sidebar.

### 2023.1.10
- Signed up a new GitHub account, created a public repo automatically linked with GitHub Pages, and a another private repo ready to hold site source files.
- Conneted git with different GitHub accounts (SSH).
- Create a brand new SSH key in the local file `~/.ssh/`, and configurated GitHub Action.
- 碎碎念：因为不熟悉git，在查各种命令的时候花费了不少时间。
